Mocking:
    Mocking is when you override or change the behavior of the dependencies of the code you are testing.
    We use it because avoid unintended side-effects also isolate the code that we want to test.

    !!! Never write test that depends on external services.
        - Can't guarantee they will be available
        - Makes tests unpredictable
        - Sending spam emails
